# Image Classification with Quantum and Classical Machine Learning

This repository contains two approaches to solving an image classification problem:

- A Quantum Image Classification approach using Qiskit.
- A Classical Image Classification approach using scikit-learn.



##  Overview

Image classification is the process of categorizing images into predefined classes. In this project, images are classified based on whether they contain vertical or horizontal binary strips. Two different machine learning paradigms are used to tackle this problem:

- **Quantum Machine Learning**: Using Qiskit and quantum circuits.
- **Classical Machine Learning**: Using traditional machine learning models with scikit-learn.
